# Regenerate

**When a human client retries, it replays. When an agent retries, it
regenerates.** That is the whole problem this repository is about.

An agent may prepare a $75,377 claim correction on its own. It may not commit
one on its own. Committing takes two things: a human decision, and a payload
that still matches what that human was shown.

Built on [TrueForge](https://github.com/truefoundry/trueforge) for the
TrueFoundry Agent Harness Hackathon, 2026-09-19.

**All data here is synthetic.** The amount mirrors a real denial, but every
name, record, and identifier in this repository is fabricated. There is no
patient data of any kind.

## The problem

An idempotency key solves the classic retry: same key, same request, one
effect. Stripe shipped that in 2015. It rests on an assumption nobody writes
down, because for thirty years it was free:

> **A retry is a replay of the same request.**

That held because the thing retrying was deterministic code. Same inputs in,
same bytes out.

An LLM retrying is not a replay. It is a re-derivation. The model may produce
different arguments and still believe it is doing the same task. So an
idempotency key keyed on the operation alone will happily commit the *wrong
payload* under the *right key*.

Nothing is broken here. The assumption was quietly invalidated by a new kind
of client.

The same gap shows up in the approval itself. A reviewer sees the arguments on
screen, but an allow/deny decision records only that the call was permitted —
not what it contained. With a deterministic client that gap is harmless,
because the arguments cannot change between approval and execution. With an
agent it is the entire problem.

So approval here binds two things that must both hold:

1. an `operation_id` the model cannot mint (server-generated), and
2. a SHA-256 hash of the exact payload that was prepared.

Approval authorizes **one payload**. A retry carrying different arguments
fails the hash check even though the operation id is correct.

### Before and after

```
before                                  after
------                                  -----
agent: send $75,377                     agent: prepare $75,377
human: APPROVE      (approves the act)  human: APPROVE   (approves this payload)
agent: [timeout, retries]               agent: [timeout, retries]
agent: send $95,000 (re-derived)        agent: send $95,000
system: approved -> PAYS $95,000        system: hash mismatch -> REFUSED
```

## What TrueForge does, and what this repo does

Stated plainly, because the boundary is the interesting part.

**TrueForge supplies:** the agent loop, MCP tool discovery and invocation,
sandboxed Python execution, the pause before a shielded tool runs, the human
allow/deny decision, session persistence across turns, and the event trace.

**This repo supplies:** the argument invariant.

TrueForge 0.2.0's approval decision is only `{"status":"allow"}` or
`{"status":"deny","reason":"..."}` against a pending tool call. It is **not**
cryptographically bound to argument values. The reviewer does see the full
arguments, but the decision carries none of them. So the payload binding is
enforced in the payer endpoint, not in the harness.

That is not a workaround. The harness pausing the agent and showing a human
the exact arguments is the only reason a second key can exist at all —
without that pause there is no moment to bind anything to.

## Tools

| Tool | Writes? | Shielded |
|---|---|---|
| `get_claim` | no | no |
| `prepare_resubmission` | no — mints `operation_id` + hash | no |
| `submit_claim` | **yes — commits to the ledger** | **yes** |

The shield is on the tool that moves money.

## Behaviour

| Scenario | Result |
|---|---|
| Prepare → approve → submit | one ledger row, receipt returned |
| Denied operation → submit | rejected, zero rows |
| Lost acknowledgement → identical retry | **one row**, original receipt replayed |
| Amount changed after approval | rejected, `payload_hash_mismatch`, zero rows |

Ledger rows are immutable: `UPDATE` and `DELETE` triggers reject mutation.

## Run it

Requires Node 22.14+.

```bash
npm install
npm test                      # four deterministic scenarios
node server/mcp-server.mjs    # payer + MCP on http://localhost:9123/mcp
```

In another terminal:

```bash
npx @truefoundry/trueforge@latest   # http://localhost:8790
```

Register the connector (no tunnel needed — both run locally):

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8790/api/v1/settings/mcp-servers \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"manifest":{"type":"remote","name":"two-key-claims",
       "url":"http://localhost:9123/mcp",
       "description":"Claims read + corrected-resubmission"}}'
```

Then configure one agent with `require_approval_for_tools: ["submit_claim"]`.
Full settings, including which runtime toggles matter and why, are in
[AGENT-SETUP.md](./AGENT-SETUP.md).

Ask the agent:

> Recover synthetic claim CLM-75377.

### Verifying end to end

```bash
./preflight.sh        # payer, tools, TrueForge, sandbox, connector, tests, clean ledger
./tests/e2e.sh        # all four scenarios over real MCP + HTTP
./reset-demo.sh       # clean ledger between runs
```

## Honest boundaries

- The payer is a mock. It has no adjudication logic and makes no claim to be
  a production claims engine.
- TrueForge 0.2.0 does not bind approvals to argument values. This repo does
  not imply otherwise.
- In production the payer would also authenticate its caller. It does not here.
- Nothing in this repository constitutes medical, billing, or legal advice.
