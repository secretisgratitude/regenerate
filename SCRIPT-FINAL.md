# The script

**Bold = do. Quoted = say.**

## Setup

```bash
./reset-demo.sh && ./preflight.sh
```

All 11 green. Then bump the terminal font, `clear`, click **Try** for a fresh
session, and record.

`e2e.sh` runs **live** at beat 3. Its row assertion is scoped to the three
operations it creates, so it passes whether or not the demo has already
written a row. Nothing to sequence around.

---

**Camera. Nothing shared.**

> "I'm Eric. This is Regenerate, built today on TrueForge.
>
> I approved the same payment twice today, and both times I was right to.
> That's what I want to show you."

**Share screen.**

> "This agent recovers a denied insurance claim. All synthetic. Three tools:
> it reads a claim, it prepares a correction - which mints an operation id on
> the server and fingerprints the exact payload - and it submits. Submit is
> the only one that writes, and the only one shielded."

**If the skill is loaded, point at it:**

> "And one skill: safe resubmission. The retry policy, written as instructions
> instead of buried in a prompt."

---

**Paste:** `Recover synthetic claim CLM-75377.`

**Talk while it runs.**

> "It reads through MCP, computes in the sandbox, prepares the correction.
> Preparing can't move money, and it doesn't choose its own operation id - the
> payer mints that."

**Card appears. Point at the amount.**

> "Claim CLM-75377, amount seventy-five thousand three hundred seventy-seven
> dollars - same digits, that's just how I built the fixture. TrueForge stops
> the agent before the write and shows me exactly what it's about to do."

**Approve ONCE. Say the receipt id.**

---

**Paste immediately:** `Assume that acknowledgement was lost. Safely retry the same operation.`

**Second card. Point at it.**

> "It asks again. TrueForge doesn't hand out reusable permissions - every write
> gets its own pause, including this retry."

**Camera.**

> "A person retries once in a while. An agent retries as a matter of course.
> The rare case just became the normal case."

**Approve ONCE. Show `replay: true` and the same receipt.**

**Switch to terminal. Before running it:**

> "Two approvals. Let's see what actually got written."

**Run:** `sqlite3 ledger.sqlite "SELECT claim_id, amount, receipt_id FROM ledger;"`

> "One row."

**Pause.**

> "Same receipt. I approved twice, and I had no way of knowing the second card
> was the same operation I'd already settled. The payer knew."

---

**Paste:** `Resubmit that same operation, but for 75378 instead.`

**It refuses in about four seconds. Let it land.**

> "It won't change the amount. The instructions held. But instructions aren't a
> guarantee - a different model, a longer session, and that holds differently.
> So the real question is what happens when they don't."

**Switch to terminal. Before running it:**

> "So let's take the model out of it."

**Run:** `./tests/e2e.sh` — **let it run in silence.**

**Point at one line:** `PASS: rejected tampered payload`

> "Tampered payload, rejected."

**Then the last line of the output:** `three operations attempted, exactly one row written`

> "Three operations attempted. One row written."

**Pause.**

> "That check doesn't depend on the model behaving well.
>
> Every one of those approvals was correct on its own. Nothing compared them.
> The payer did."

---

> "Idempotency isn't new. What's new is that the thing retrying is an agent and
> the thing approving is a person.
>
> This is an application-side concern, not a harness one - the harness
> authorizes calls, and that's the right job for it. So I built the memory
> where the consequence lands: in the payer."

**Camera.**

> "An approval that only says yes stops being enough the moment the thing
> asking can change its mind."

**Pause.**

> "A yes should mean yes to *this*."

**Stop talking. Stop recording.**

## The six that decide the take

1. **Reset before every take.** A dirty ledger breaks the "one row" line.
2. **Approve exactly once** per card. Two cards.
3. **Paste the next prompt immediately**, then talk over the run.
4. **Point at two lines** in the e2e output - the tamper PASS and the final count. Never read the whole thing.
5. **Silence while a command runs.** Two seconds of output with nobody talking
   is confidence. Filling it is nerves.
6. **Nothing after "yes to this."**

## Q&A if you are top ten

- *"Why not in the harness?"* -> "I asked. It's app-side. That's where I put it."
- *"Isn't this Okta?"* -> "Identity tells you who's asking. It doesn't tell you
  what you already answered."
- *Don't know* -> "I'd have to check before I tell you something wrong."
